# Replication: Shrinking the Cross-Section

This repository hosts the replication of findings from the paper titled *Shrinking the Cross-Section* by **S. Kozak, S. Nagel, and S. Santosh**, published in the Journal of Financial Economics in 2020. The paper explores the construction of a robust stochastic discount factor (SDF) that encapsulates the collective explanatory power of numerous cross-sectional stock return predictors through an economically substantiated prior on SDF coefficients, providing a robust out-of-sample performance in high-dimensional settings.

## Abstract:
> We construct a robust stochastic discount factor (SDF) that summarizes the joint explanatory power of a large number of cross-sectional stock return predictors. Our method achieves robust out-of-sample performance in this high-dimensional setting by imposing an economically motivated prior on SDF coefficients that shrinks the contributions of low-variance principal components of the candidate factors. While empirical asset pricing research has focused on SDFs with a small number of characteristics-based factors --- e.g., the four- or five-factor models discussed in the recent literature --- we find that such a characteristics-sparse SDF cannot adequately summarize the cross-section of expected stock returns. However, a relatively small number of principal components of the universe of potential characteristics-based factors can approximate the SDF quite well.

### In-sample and Out-of-Sample Cross-Sectional R^2 Analysis
> This section displays the original and replicated plots that present the in-sample cross-sectional R^2 (dashed line), out-of-sample (OOS) cross-sectional R^2 based on cross-validation (solid line), and OOS cross-sectional R^2 based on the proportional shrinkage (dash-dot line) as per PÃ¡stor and Stambaugh (2000).
